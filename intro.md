# DS413 - Elective 4 (Deep Learning) Jupyter Book Compilation

## **GitHub Page with Jupyter Book Compilation**

This site is the official compilation of my work for **DS413 â€“ Elective 4 (Deep Learning)**.  
It presents the outputs of activities, exercises, and projects completed throughout the course in the form of Jupyter Notebooks, organized and published as a Jupyter Book.

## Objective
The primary objective of this deliverable is to demonstrate my ability to:
- Host a Jupyter Book on GitHub Pages.  
- Compile and document deep learning coursework in a professional and reproducible format.  
- Build a portfolio that highlights both theoretical understanding and applied problem-solving in deep learning.
